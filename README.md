## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
One conclusion that I can draw from the outcomes based on launch date, May seems to be the best day to have the best probability of success.
The other conclusion that I can draw is that December seems to have the lowest success to fail ratio. It may not have the most failed numerically, which is October, but based on the ratio, Decemember has the worst ratio.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
One conclusion that I am observing is that the best success rate and lowest cancellation/failure rate is less than $1000. If possible, keeping the goal to less than $5000 seems to be the best chance of success. There is a sharp drop in success rate after $45000.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Some limitations of this data set is that the data doesn't show the external factors that might come into these kickstarters. For example, a good way for kickstarters to find success is to take a small budget for some sort of marketing. It doesn't have to be a huge amount and can be contributed into the final kickstarter goal amount. We don't know if any of these kickstarters had a budget for marketing which could skew the data to be more favorable in a particular way. This might explain how the large goal of $40,000 to $45,000 had a little more success rate. More money means they can afford to use some of the budget on marketing.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Another table/graph that might be useful is to see the spotlight to successrate. I noticed that the spotlight being true seems to have some amount of correlation with successrate or even percentage funded. This spotlight might be some of that marketing I mentioned earlier - I'm not too keen on it since it is not explained. If this is what I assume to be, then it might be interesting to have a focus on the spotlight and ensure that a new kickstarter should be spotlighted or not. If I were to take it further, maybe looking at spotlight and kickstarter goal amount with maybe success rate could be interesting as well.
